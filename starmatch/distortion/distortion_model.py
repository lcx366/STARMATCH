def RadialStandard(coeffs,dc,pixels_xy):
    """
    Calculate the corrected pixel coordinates based on the Standard Radial Distortion Model(SRDM) defined by the distortion center and the distortion coefficients.

    Inputs:
        coeffs -> [list] Coefficients associated with the SRDM, such as [-1e-4,1e-4]
        dc -> [list(2 elements)] Distortion center associated with the SRDM, such as [0.1,0.1]
        pixels_xy -> [list(2 elements),array(n*2)] Distorted pixel coordinates, such as [367,125] or [[2.8671875, 0.9765625], [1.109375, -0.875]]
    Outputs：
        xuyu -> [2d array(n*2)] Distortion-corrected pixel coordinates

    Note:
    The 3rd order polynomial in standard form: ru = rd + k1 * rd**3
    The 5th order polynomial in standard form: ru = rd + k1 * rd**3 + k2 * rd**5
    The 5th order polynomial in all form: ru = rd + k1 * rd**2 + k2 * rd**3 + k3 * rd**4 + k4 * rd**5,
    where rd is the distance between the distorted pixel coordinates and the distortion center, ru is the distance between the distortion-corrected pixel coordinates and the distortion center.

    1. The 3rd order polynomial in standard form only works well for small amounts of distortion.
    2. The 5th order polynomial produce more accurate results, especially for “wave” or “mustache” distortion, which might resemble barrel near the center of the image and pincushion near the corners (or vice-versa).
    3. The 5th order all form use all coefficients up to the maximum instead of alternate coefficients (odd or even-only). We have not observed much advantage to these settings.
    4. Higher order polynomials (7th order or higher) should be used with great care because results can become unstable, especially at the outer parts of the image. The image used to calculate the coefficients should have valid corner points near the edge of the image and there should be sufficient rows or columns. 

    Basic formulas are as follows:
    xu - xc = ru * Cos(theta) = ru * (xd - xc)/rd = ... 
    yu - yc = ru * Sin(theta) = ru * (yd - yc)/rd = ... 
    where (x_c,y_c) is the pixel coordinates of the distortion center.
